 * @param[in] itFlags
 * @param[in] noTreeBuildThreshold Any variants with frequency/count below this threshold do not
 *      contribute to the tree building. If you are mapping mutations directly, then they will be
 *      mapped by creating a Mutation node and one edge per sample.
 * @param[in] indivIdToPop Map from individual identifier to population identifier.
 * @param[in] rebuildProportion When the nearest-neighbor index reached this proportion of deleted
 *      items, rebuild it. Default: 0.25.
