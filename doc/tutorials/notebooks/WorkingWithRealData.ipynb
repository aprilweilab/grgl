    "In this tutorial we're going to download publicly available [1,000 Genomes Project](https://www.internationalgenome.org/) data and examine it with GRG. The goal is just to illustrate the ease with which you can work with such datasets. We also illustrate how to include population information in GRG for a real dataset.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Building a GRG from real data, including population information\n",
    "* Using GRG matrix multiplication to calculate population-specific allele frequencies\n",
    "* Using [grapp](https://github.com/aprilweilab/grapp) to filter information out of a GRG\n",

    "1. By removing a subset of samples.\n",
