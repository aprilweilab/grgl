    "# Converting .vcf.gz to GRG\n",
    "\n",
    "Many datasets are stored in `.vcf.gz` format by \"default.\" If these datasets are large, they are usually stored using [BGZIP](https://www.htslib.org/doc/bgzip.html) so that they can be indexed for semi-random access. The two different kinds of index files for `BGZIP` are [tabix](https://www.htslib.org/doc/tabix.html) or [bcftools](https://samtools.github.io/bcftools/bcftools.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we'll show the (very simple) process of converting `.vcf.gz` data to `GRG` format, which is much smaller (usually at least `25x` smaller) and faster (many orders of magnitude) for performing computations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you'll need:**\n",
    "* Python dependencies \"pygrgl\": `pip install pygrgl`\n",
    "* Command line tools \"wget\" and \"tabix\": `sudo apt install wget tabix` (or your distribution's equivalent)"
